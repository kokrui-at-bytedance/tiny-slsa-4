# FizzBuzz SLSA L4

Welcome to my FizzBuzz app!

## Build
- Every push to the repository will run the `build-me` GitHub Action. This will build the project (through a hosted service) and generate provenance (authenticated since generated by GitHub Actions).
- You may download the artifact in the Actions page of the repository.
- Reproducibility note: Go packages are vendored and therefore meet reproducibility requirements. However, Go itself is installed by version number and the Ubuntu image is also identified by version number due to concerns of bloat. Also, the slsa-github-generator action is identified by version instead of hash (see: https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/issues/12)

## Usage
- `./main`
- Input a positive integer and the program will return you the output of FizzBuzz up till that integer! Wow!
