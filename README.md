# FizzBuzz SLSA L4

Welcome to my FizzBuzz app!

## Build
- Every push to the repository will run the `build-me` GitHub Action. This will build the project (through a hosted service) and generate provenance (authenticated since generated by GitHub Actions).
- You may download the artifact in the Actions page of the repository.

## Usage
- `./main`
- Input a positive integer and the program will return you the output of FizzBuzz up till that integer! Wow!
